# Client-Recorder

This package allows you to set up web session recording in your web apps.

## Getting Started

Please note, the `baseUrl` comes from the client that you have registered in ComplyCO's dashboard. It will look like `app-<...>.client.complyco.com`.

The `onAuthTokenRequested` callback will need to hit an endpoint on your backend which is configured to generate and sign a JWT.
The client that you have registered in ComplyCO's dashboard should be configured with the public key that corresponds with the private key used
for signing in your backend API.

```ts
import { createClientRecorder } from "@complyco/client-recorder-web";
import { GzipPlugin } from "@complyco/client-recorder-web/plugins";

// initialize the recorder once for your pageload
const recorder = createClientRecorder({
  syncOptions: {
    baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WIDGET_API as string,
    onAuthTokenRequested,
    plugins: [GzipPlugin],
  },
});

// if your JWT callback function changes, you can pass in your new one
recorder.setOnAuthTokenRequested(onAuthTokenRequested);

// start the recording; you only need to do this once.
// NOTE: The argument is optional. This example shows the defaults
recorder.record({
  blockClass: "complyco-block",
  ignoreClass: "complyco-ignore",
  maskTextClass: "complyco-mask",
  maskAllInputs: true,
  captureNavigation: false,
});

// stops the recording and forces a sync to ComplyCO's backend.
recorder.shutdown();
```

### Masking

All inputs are masked by default, but you can choose to unmask all inputs.

You can configure the recorder with block, ignore and mask text classes, or you can use our defaults. Our defaults are:

- complyco-block
- complyco-ignore
- complyco-mask

If your UI already has classes from Sentry's Replay functionality, you can just pass the appropriate class names when invoking `recorder.record(...)`.

### Navigation

The `captureNavigation` option allows you to track page navigation events within your single-page application. When enabled, it will record URL changes that occur through:
- History API calls (`pushState`, `replaceState`)
- Browser back/forward navigation
- Hash changes

### Plugins

Use of plugins is optional, but they may offer performance improvements in certain cases.

- GzipPlugin: Compresses the recording when sending it to ComplyCO's backend.

## A React example

```tsx
"use client";
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { createClientRecorder } from "@complyco/client-recorder-web";
import { GzipPlugin } from "@complyco/client-recorder-web/plugins";

export type AuthTracerProviderProps = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onAuthTokenRequested: any | undefined;
};

export default function AuthTracerProvider({ children, onAuthTokenRequested }: AuthTracerProviderProps) {
  const [recorder] = useState(() => {
    return createClientRecorder({
      syncOptions: {
        baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WIDGET_API as string,
        onAuthTokenRequested,
        plugins: [GzipPlugin],
      },
    });
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (onAuthTokenRequested) {
      recorder.setOnAuthTokenRequested(onAuthTokenRequested);
    }
  }, [recorder, onAuthTokenRequested]);

  useEffect(() => {
    recorder.record();

    return () => {
      recorder.shutdown();
    };
  });

  return null;
}
```
